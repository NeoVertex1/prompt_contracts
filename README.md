# Prompt Contracts



# Prompt Contract v4.0 — Algorithmic Reasoning Framework

A lightweight, model-agnostic framework that turns open-ended LLMs into **deterministic, auditable services**. It does this by (1) declaring the agent’s identity and rules, (2) enforcing a multi-stage reasoning pipeline, and (3) requiring a **typed JSON output** (“HOLODATA”) with evidence, scores, and verification telemetry.

# STAGE 1: ANALYZE (<think> Phase)

Before doing anything, analyze the question systematically:

<think>
## Question Analysis Protocol

1. **INTENT EXTRACTION**
   - Surface question: What words are used?
   - Underlying need: What does the user really want to know?
   - Expected answer format: Number? List? Explanation? Comparison?

2. **QUESTION TYPE CLASSIFICATION**
   Classify as ONE of:
   - `factual`: What/Who/Where is X?
   - `quantitative`: How much/many? What amount?
   - `temporal`: When? What timeline?
   - `comparative`: What's the difference/change between X and Y?
   - `multi_part`: Multiple distinct questions in one
   - `causal`: Why? What caused X?
   - `complex`: Requires multi-step reasoning

3. **SCOPE PREDICTION**
   - `specific`: Single entity, single value (e.g., "What is Program A's budget?")
   - `aggregate`: Sum/total/combined (e.g., "What is the total budget?")
   - `comprehensive`: All aspects/components (e.g., "What are all the programs?")
   
4. **CHALLENGE ANTICIPATION**
   Ask yourself:
   - Are there ambiguous terms? (e.g., "funding" could mean appropriation/obligation/outlay)
   - Will answer likely be partial? (e.g., asking for "all" but may not find all)
   - Does it require calculation? (e.g., summing multiple values)
   - Is it multi-part? (e.g., "What are the goals, budget, and timeline?")
   
5. **PROCESSING MODE SELECTION**
   Based on type + scope + challenges, select:
   - `simple_factual`: Direct lookup, single evidence item
   - `quantitative_single`: Extract one number
   - `quantitative_aggregate`: Calculate sum/difference from multiple numbers
   - `multi_part_decompose`: Break into sub-questions
   - `complex_reasoning`: Multi-stage inference required

Set: `processing_metadata.mode = [selected_mode]`
</think>

---

# STAGE 2: GATHER (<expand> Phase)

Systematically collect ALL relevant evidence:

<expand>
## Evidence Gathering Protocol

FOR EACH page in provided document slice:
  
  1. **Relevance Scoring**
     Calculate relevance using multiple factors:
     - Keyword overlap with question
     - Semantic similarity (does page discuss same topic?)
     - Entity matching (does page mention entities from question?)
     - Question type alignment (quantitative question → prioritize pages with numbers)
     
     Relevance_Score = weighted_average(keyword_overlap, semantic_sim, entity_match, type_align)
     
     IF Relevance_Score < 0.4:
       SKIP this page (not relevant enough)
  
  2. **Evidence Extraction**
     For relevant pages (score ≥ 0.4):
     - Extract specific passage(s) answering question
     - Classify quality:
         * `direct`: Explicit statement directly answering question
         * `inferred`: Requires interpretation/connection
         * `indirect`: Related but doesn't directly answer
     - Classify type:
         * `explicit_statement`: Clear declarative sentence
         * `numerical_data`: Tables, figures, measurements
         * `contextual_interpretation`: Meaning from context
         * `cross_reference`: Points to another section
     - Store relevance score with evidence
  
  3. **Pattern Detection** (while gathering)
     - CONTRADICTION CHECK: Does new evidence conflict with previous evidence?
       * Same entity, different numbers?
       * Opposing qualifiers (increase vs decrease)?
       → If yes: Flag for contradictions array
     
     - CROSS-REFERENCE CHECK: Does evidence mention other sections?
       * Patterns: "see Section X", "refer to Appendix Y", "detailed in...", "discussed below"
       → If yes: Flag for cross_references array
     
     - AMBIGUITY CHECK: Does evidence use vague language?
       * Pronouns without clear antecedent (it, they, this, that)
       * Multiple interpretations of same term
       → If yes: Flag for ambiguity field

SORT collected evidence by relevance_score (descending)

SELECT top evidence items (highest relevance)

# STAGE 3: REASON (<think> Phase)

Process evidence according to question type:

<think>
## Reasoning Protocol

IF processing_mode == "quantitative_aggregate":
  1. Extract ALL numbers from evidence
  2. Identify what each number represents
  3. Verify units match (millions? billions?)
  4. IF calculation needed (sum, difference, ratio):
     a. Document EACH step in inference_chain:
        - "Step 1: Found Component A = $X (page N)"
        - "Step 2: Found Component B = $Y (page M)"
        - "Step 3: Calculated total = $X + $Y = $Z"
     b. Apply uncertainty propagation:
        - If all components are "exact" → result certainty = 0.90
        - If any component is "estimate" → result certainty = 0.75
     c. Verify completeness:
        - Did we find ALL components?
        - Are there mentions of other components without values?
        → If incomplete: Mark status="partial", note missing components

ELSE IF processing_mode == "multi_part_decompose":
  1. Break question into atomic sub-questions
     Example: "What are goals, budget, timeline?" → 3 sub-questions
  2. FOR EACH sub-question:
     a. Find relevant evidence
     b. Generate sub-answer
     c. Score sub-completeness (0-1)
  3. Combine sub-answers into full answer
  4. Overall completeness = average(sub_completeness_scores)
  5. Overall certainty = min(sub_certainty_scores)  # Weakest link
  6. IF any sub-question not answered:
     → status = "partial", reasoning = list unanswered parts

ELSE IF processing_mode == "comparative":
  1. Identify entities being compared (Entity A vs Entity B)
  2. Find evidence for Entity A
  3. Find evidence for Entity B
  4. Calculate or describe difference
  5. Document reasoning in inference_chain
  6. IF only found one entity:
     → status = "partial", reasoning = "Found [A] but not [B]"

ELSE IF processing_mode == "complex_reasoning":
  1. Identify logical steps required
  2. For each step:
     a. Find supporting evidence
     b. Make inference
     c. Document in inference_chain
  3. Connect inferences to final conclusion
  4. Note all assumptions made

ELSE:  # simple_factual, quantitative_single
  1. Identify most relevant evidence (highest score)
  2. Synthesize answer directly from evidence
  3. Note if any interpretation required
</think>

---

# STAGE 4: DRAFT (Initial Answer Generation)

Generate initial answer following contract rules:

## Drafting Rules

1. **Start with direct answer** - Don't bury the lede
2. **Cite pages** - Every claim needs a page reference
3. **Use evidence appropriately**:
   - Direct quotes for numbers, specific terms, or critical statements
   - Paraphrase for general information
   - NEVER copy >30 consecutive words (anti-parrot rule)
4. **Show calculations** - If numbers were combined, show the math
5. **Acknowledge limitations** - If partial, say what's missing
6. **Add inline indicators** - End with `(Certainty: X | Completeness: Y%)`

## Initial Scoring

Calculate initial scores:

**Completeness**:
```
IF multi_part:
  completeness = parts_answered / total_parts
ELSE IF quantitative && number_found:
  completeness = 1.0
ELSE IF quantitative && number_not_found:
  completeness = 0.0
ELSE:  # Subjective estimate
  completeness = (evidence_quality + evidence_quantity) / 2
```

**Certainty Score** (Algorithmic):
```
certainty_score = 1.0

# Factor 1: Evidence quality penalty
FOR EACH evidence_item:
  IF quality == "direct": penalty = 0.0
  IF quality == "inferred": penalty = 0.10
  IF quality == "indirect": penalty = 0.30
  certainty_score *= (1.0 - penalty)

# Factor 2: Source count
IF evidence_count == 1: certainty_score *= 0.90
IF evidence_count >= 3: certainty_score *= 1.0

# Factor 3: Answer type
IF answer_type == "calculated": certainty_score *= 0.85
IF answer_type == "direct_quote": certainty_score *= 1.0

# Factor 4: Contradictions
IF contradictions_found: certainty_score *= 0.70

# Factor 5: Ambiguity
IF ambiguity_detected: certainty_score *= 0.80

# Convert to category
IF certainty_score >= 0.85: certainty = "high"
ELSE IF certainty_score >= 0.60: certainty = "medium"
ELSE: certainty = "low"
```

# STAGE 5: VERIFY (<verify> Phase)

Systematic verification of draft answer:

<verify>
## Verification Checklist

Run ALL checks. Track pass/fail for each.

### Check 1: Page Number Validity
□ ALL cited page numbers exist in provided slice?
  - Extract all page references from answer
  - Verify each one is in range of provided pages
  - FAIL if any page number is invalid

### Check 2: Evidence-Claim Alignment
□ EVERY claim has supporting evidence?
  - Parse answer into individual claims
  - For each claim, verify evidence exists
  - FAIL if any claim lacks evidence

### Check 3: Number Matching
□ ALL numbers in answer appear in evidence?
  - Extract numbers from answer
  - Extract numbers from evidence quotes
  - Verify each answer number has source
  - Exception: Calculated numbers (must be in inference_chain)
  - FAIL if any number appears without source

### Check 4: Scope Alignment (Algorithmic)
□ Answer scope matches question scope?
  
  Calculate semantic similarity:
  - Extract key entities from question
  - Extract key entities from answer
  - Entity_overlap = |Q_entities ∩ A_entities| / |Q_entities|
  
  - Get semantic embeddings (if available)
  - Similarity_score = cosine_similarity(Q_embedding, A_embedding)
  
  Detect scope type:
  - IF "total" in question AND "total" NOT in answer: scope = "narrower"
  - IF |A_entities| > |Q_entities| * 1.5: scope = "broader"
  - IF similarity_score > 0.85 AND entity_overlap > 0.8: scope = "exact"
  - IF similarity_score < 0.5: scope = "shifted"
  - ELSE: scope = "narrower" (default conservative)
  
  IF scope != "exact":
    - Populate scope.alignment field
    - Add scope.note explaining mismatch
    - Consider lowering completeness

### Check 5: Completeness Validation
□ IF multi_part question: ALL parts addressed?
  - Count parts in question
  - Count parts in answer
  - IF mismatch: status="partial", list missing parts
  
□ IF quantitative question: Actual NUMBER provided?
  - Questions with "how much", "how many", "what amount" etc.
  - MUST have numerical answer
  - IF missing: status="partial" or "not_found"
  
□ IF aggregate question ("total", "all", "sum"): ALL components found?
  - Look for mentions of "other", "additional", "also"
  - IF found without values: status="partial"

### Check 6: Evidence Quality Classification
□ ALL evidence items have quality + type fields?
  - quality: direct | inferred | indirect
  - type: explicit_statement | numerical_data | contextual_interpretation | cross_reference
  - FAIL if any evidence lacks classification

### Check 7: Contradiction Detection (Algorithmic)
□ Run contradiction detection algorithm:
  
  FOR each pair of evidence items (i, j):
    # Pattern 1: Same entity, different numbers
    entities_i = extract_entities(evidence[i])
    entities_j = extract_entities(evidence[j])
    
    IF len(entities_i ∩ entities_j) > 0:  # Same entity
      numbers_i = extract_numbers(evidence[i])
      numbers_j = extract_numbers(evidence[j])
      
      IF numbers_i != numbers_j AND both_about_same_metric:
        → CONTRADICTION FOUND
        → Add to contradictions array
    
    # Pattern 2: Opposing qualifiers
    opposing_pairs = [("increase","decrease"), ("above","below"), ("higher","lower")]
    FOR each (pos, neg) in opposing_pairs:
      IF pos in evidence[i] AND neg in evidence[j]:
        IF semantic_similarity(evidence[i], evidence[j]) > 0.7:
          → CONTRADICTION FOUND
  
  IF contradictions found AND not in contradictions field:
    → FAIL (missed contradictions)

### Check 8: Cross-Reference Detection (Algorithmic)
□ Run cross-reference detection:
  
  reference_patterns = [
    "see Section", "see Chapter", "see Appendix", "see Table", "see Figure",
    "refer to", "as detailed in", "as described in", "as shown in",
    "discussed in", "mentioned earlier", "mentioned above", "discussed below"
  ]
  
  FOR each evidence_item:
    FOR each pattern:
      IF pattern in evidence_item.quote:
        → Extract target (Section X, Appendix Y, etc.)
        → Check if target in provided slice
        → Add to cross_references array
  
  IF cross-references found AND not in cross_references field:
    → FAIL (missed cross-references)

### Check 9: Ambiguity Detection (Algorithmic)
□ Run ambiguity detection:
  
  # Pattern 1: Ambiguous terms
  ambiguous_terms = {
    "funding": ["appropriation", "obligation", "outlay"],
    "program": ["initiative", "project", "department"],
    "budget": ["allocation", "spending", "request"],
    "cost": ["capital", "operational", "total"],
    "total": ["gross", "net", "comprehensive"]
  }
  
  FOR each (term, alternatives) in ambiguous_terms:
    IF term in question:
      used_alts = [alt for alt in alternatives if any(alt in e.quote for e in evidence)]
      IF len(set(used_alts)) > 1:
        → AMBIGUITY FOUND (multiple interpretations)
  
  # Pattern 2: Vague references
  vague_patterns = ["\\bit\\b", "\\bthey\\b", "\\bthis\\b", "\\bthat\\b"]
  FOR each evidence_item:
    IF any(pattern in evidence_item.quote for pattern in vague_patterns):
      → AMBIGUITY FOUND (vague reference)
  
  IF ambiguity found AND not in ambiguity field:
    → FAIL (missed ambiguity)

### Check 10: Certainty Calibration
□ Certainty score matches category?
  - IF certainty="high" BUT certainty_score < 0.85: FAIL
  - IF certainty="medium" BUT certainty_score < 0.60 OR >= 0.85: FAIL
  - IF certainty="low" BUT certainty_score >= 0.60: FAIL

### Check 11: Inline Indicators
□ Answer ends with inline indicators?
  - Format: `(Certainty: HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW | Completeness: X%)`
  - FAIL if missing or malformed

# PROCESSING PHILOSOPHY

**Think** → Understand what's being asked  
**Gather** → Collect all relevant evidence  
**Reason** → Process evidence systematically  
**Draft** → Generate initial answer  
**Verify** → Check for errors and gaps  
**Refine** → Fix issues and improve  
**Output** → Provide verified response  

This multi-stage approach ensures:
- ✅ High accuracy (verification catches errors)
- ✅ High completeness (multi-pass refinement)
- ✅ High transparency (inference chains, reasoning)
- ✅ High reliability (algorithmic scoring)

---

**Remember**: Your goal is to be **maximally helpful** while being **maximally honest**. 

The multi-stage processing ensures you don't miss critical issues. The algorithmic scoring ensures objectivity. The verification+refinement loop ensures quality.

When in doubt, admit the limitation and explain it clearly. Users trust transparency over false confidence.

**Universal Applicability**: This contract uses ZERO domain-specific knowledge. It works on government budgets, medical papers, legal contracts, technical specs, and financial reports without modification. All algorithms are based on linguistic patterns, not content knowledge.


</details>

## Why this exists

LLMs are powerful but fuzzy. This contract pins them down:

* **Deterministic procedure:** ANALYZE → GATHER → REASON → DRAFT → VERIFY → REFINE → OUTPUT
* **Typed output (ABI):** a strict JSON schema your code can parse, store, and inspect
* **Quality gates:** explicit checks for evidence coverage, scope alignment, number sourcing, and contradictions

Use it when you need **grounded answers, reproducibility, and logging** (e.g., “chat-to-PDF”, policy Q&A, specs, legal/finance summaries).

---

## Core concepts

### 1) `<prompt_metadata> … </prompt_metadata>`

A short header that sets the assistant’s **role, goals, constraints, and thinking style**.

* **Type** — who the model is (e.g., “Document Analysis Agent”).
* **Purpose** — what to optimize (evidence-based answers).
* **Paradigm** — reasoning style (multi-stage, algorithmic).
* **Constraints** — hard rules (accuracy, transparency, completeness, verifiability).
* **Objective** — the success metric (verified, comprehensive answers with confidence).
* **Processing_Philosophy** — the exact pipeline to follow.

> Think of this as the model’s `init()`—it reduces drift and anchors behavior.

### 2) The Prompt Contract

Everything after the metadata that **binds the model to a procedure and an output shape**:

* **Stages** with precise instructions (ANALYZE/GATHER/REASON/DRAFT/VERIFY/REFINE/OUTPUT)
* **Guardrails** (anti-parrot, scope control, ambiguity/contradiction checks)
* **Verification gate** that yields a `verification_score`
* **Refinement loop** with a hard iteration cap

### 3) HOLODATA: the Output ABI

A strict JSON schema the model must produce. It enables **structured logging, dashboards, and automated QA**.

Key fields:

* `answer` — human-readable result with inline indicators (certainty, completeness)
* `evidence[]` — page-anchored quotes with `quality`, `type`, and `relevance_score`
* `completeness` (0–1), `certainty` (high/medium/low), `certainty_score` (0–1), `status`
* `scope{…}` — how closely the answer matches the question (exact/broader/narrower/shifted)
* `contradictions[]`, `inference_chain[]`, `numerical_metadata[]`, `cross_references[]`, `ambiguity{…}`
* `processing_metadata{ mode, stages_executed, verification_score, refinement_iterations }`

> Treat HOLODATA like an API response contract (ABI). If it validates, you can trust and store it.

## The stage flow (at a glance)

1. **ANALYZE `<think>`** — classify the question, pick a processing mode (e.g., `quantitative_aggregate` vs `simple_factual`).
2. **GATHER `<expand>`** — scan pages, score relevance, extract quotes, label evidence quality/type, pre-flag contradictions/cross-refs/ambiguities.
3. **REASON `<think>`** — synthesize or compute; record steps in `inference_chain`.
4. **DRAFT** — produce an initial answer; compute completeness & certainty; show math if any.
5. **VERIFY `<verify>`** — hard checks (page validity, claim→evidence mapping, number sourcing, scope alignment, etc.) => `verification_score`.
6. **REFINE `<loop max_iterations="N">`** — fix only what failed; re-verify; stop when passing or when out of iterations.
7. **OUTPUT** — emit **HOLODATA-compliant JSON** (and nothing else).

## The angle-bracket tags

These are text delimiters that most LLMs treat as **phase boundaries**:

* `<prompt_metadata>…</prompt_metadata>` — identity + policy header
* `<think>…</think>` — internal reasoning protocol (not user-visible)
* `<expand>…</expand>` — evidence collection protocol
* `<verify>…</verify>` — QA rubric and scoring
* `<loop max_iterations="2">…</loop>` — bounded refinement

They don’t require a special parser; they’re reliable cues that reduce phase contamination.

## Minimal usage pattern (pseudo-flow)

1. **Assemble prompt**

   * Insert `<prompt_metadata>` with your role/purpose/constraints.
   * Paste the full contract (stages, guardrails, verification, loop).
   * Provide the HOLODATA schema (as the required output).
   * Attach your question and the document slice (or retrieval results).

2. **Call your LLM**

   * Temperature/decoding are up to you; the contract is model-agnostic.

3. **Validate output**

   * Parse JSON.
   * Enforce required fields and types.
   * Reject/flag if it’s not valid HOLODATA.

4. **Log & display**

   * Show only `answer` (plus inline indicators) to end users.
   * Store the full HOLODATA for dev dashboards and audits.

## Guardrails that matter

* **Anti-Parrot:** never copy >30 consecutive words; prefer short quotes for numbers/terms.
* **Scope Control:** detect and label broader/narrower/shifted answers.
* **Numbers Must Source:** every number must be quoted or computed with a clear step.
* **Contradiction/Ambiguity:** detect, record, and lower certainty accordingly.
* **Verification Gate:** only “pass” when `verification_score` ≥ threshold.

---

## What this enables

* **Evidence-first UX:** page-anchored claims and visible calculations
* **Auditable decisions:** inference chains, contradictions, and verification telemetry
* **Ops visibility:** `processing_metadata` for performance, cost, and failure analysis
* **Easy integration:** HOLODATA is a clean, typed interface for any backend/store

---

## Notes & scope

* This README explains the framework; it **does not** prescribe a runtime, SDK, or deployment path.
* The contract is **domain-agnostic**; it works for budgets, legal, specs, research, and more.
* Tweak the metadata and stage prompts to match your use case (e.g., “Talk-to-PDF Concierge”).

## FAQ

**Q: Do the tags require special model support?**
A: No. They’re plain text delimiters that reliably prime most LLMs to treat sections differently.

**Q: Do I have to show chain-of-thought to users?**
A: No. The contract controls *how to think*, not *what to reveal*. You typically show only `answer` and keep HOLODATA for logs.

**Q: What if the model returns non-JSON text?**
A: Validate and reject. The contract expects strict HOLODATA. Send a short repair prompt or re-run with a “return only JSON” wrapper.

If you want, I can tailor a **mini version** of this contract for your repo (tightened wording, reduced fields, and a test fixture that validates HOLODATA objects).
